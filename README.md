## Online Store Project for Frontend Frameworks (CodeSpace)
 
The brief was to create a responsive, visually-engaging e-commerce site for handmade goods, fashion or furniture. Using Vue CLI for the shop page, the user is able to add items to the cart, delete items and the total cost of current items in the cart is shown and the data persists on reloading the page. 

The website should include
* a banner image
* featured product section
* new collection
* about page with team photo
* lookbook page with gallery
* contact form with Google map
* buttons should expand when a user hovers over them from about 100% to 102%
* a sticky navbar
* a logo
* a back-to-top button with smooth scroll
